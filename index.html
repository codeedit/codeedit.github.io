        <h1>Concept</h1>
        <p>The goal is simple. We want to create a project that developers can enjoy and add on to. Code Edit (if we call it that) is aiming to be an open source text editor that anyone can contribute to and can be installed on nearly any platform. We plan to achieve this by distributing Code Edit as a lightweight Chrome app that anyone can download for free. We've created a <a href="https://github.com/codeedit/">GitHub organization</a> where improvements can be made. We will add more files upon the launch of Code Edit. If you would like to hack/try code edit before the masses, go ahead and request an invite (don't worry, we don't bite).</p>

        <h1>Feature Filled</h1> <!-- Feature Rich?? -->
        <p>There are a few features that we plan to ship with the release version of Code Edit. Some of these have already been finished while others haven't even been started. We sure could use your help. </p>

        <p>Our hope is to implement all of these with web technologies using minimal code and supporting fast load times. We want Code Edit to include the tools that you need to increase productivity. Once we get these down we can always add more features to the next release of Code Edit with a few clicks and a GitHub account. </p>

        <h1>Solid Backend</h1>
        <p>Code Edit is built on top of trusted technologies like Chromium, HTML5, and JavaScript. Because we can harness the power of Chrome, we were able to make the backend that we've developed extremely small. If you wanted to go with the basics, you could run a <a href="https://github.com/codeedit/dirt/">primitive version</a> of Code Edit with less than 1MB of available storage, which we think is pretty impressive. More details about the backed of Code Edit will be displayed when the project is released to the general public.</p>

      <h1>Add With Ease</h1>
      <p>Being hosted on GitHub allows collaborators to add features in seconds, and get the help that they need with their additions. We plan to publish Code Edit from a ZIP downloaded directly from the Git repo, allowing the latest features to be pushed to users everywhere. Chrome can auto update apps, so users don't have to worry about having the latest version, we can send it right to them.</p>

      <h1>Small Yet Powerful</h1>
      <p>Code Edit has the potential to leverage the full power of Chromium but still be small and diverse enough to be installed on nearly any computer. We already have the basics down, from this point forward it's all about adding new features and code that will let us thrive. We don't want Code Edit to feel like an extension to the browser, rather that the browser is just the means for installing the app. Our goal is to have an app that anyone can enjoy using and help create, an app that runs on the desktop but is powered by the web. Saying that we'll have a packaged app like this is a big promise, one that we'll try to keep with your help. It's about time that every platform gets a text editor that is uniform. We want a development environment that gives you the power to access your full potential and get work done with the tools that will help any developer.</p>

      <h1>Contribute</h1>
      <p>We need your help to make an editor like this.  You could write new code or test ours, whatever you like. Making an editor that is powerful yet simple is hard enough, but when you try to do that with web technologies and make it run on Windows, Mac, Linux, and Chrome OS it gets ten times harder.</p>
